<h1>FIXM Flight Plan Examples</h1>
<p>The core focus of FIXM version 1 has been to model the data elements in ICAO format flight plans (FPL). This page presents some example ICAO flights plans and the corresponding FIXM XML document. The FIXM documents have been generated by an Airservices Australia utility that reads ICAO format flight plans, decodes them, and generates the corresponding FIXM objects. The flight plan examples are operational flight plans that have passed through Airservices Australia's AFTN message switch.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java classes are generated by JAXB from the FIXM schema;</li>
  <li>The flight plan is parsed and decoded, and the JAXB classes used to create a Java object corresponding to the flight plan;</li>
  <li>JAXB is used to marshal the Java object and create the FIXM XML document.</li>
</ul>
<p>For further information on the translation between ICAO flight plans and FIXM documents, refer to <a href="http://www.fixm.aero/sites/default/files/documents/FIXM%20via%20FPL.pdf">FIXM via FPL</a>.</p>
<p>The example ICAO flight plans are accessed via the links below. Each example consists of a FIXM XML document, with the ICAO FPL from which it was derived displayed as a comment at the top of the XML document. The examples comply with the <a href="http://www.fixm.aero/fixm_11">FIXM V1.1</a> schema.</p>
